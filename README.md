# Order Info App

This application allows users to retrieve order details by entering their order number and ZIP code.

Built with [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/), this app provides server-side rendering and routing capabilities, ensuring a fast and seamless user experience.

## Features

- **Form Input**: Users can input their order number and ZIP code to retrieve order details.
- **Order Details Display**: Once the form is submitted, order details are displayed on a separate page.
- **Mocked API Calls**: The current app uses mocked API responses, but this can be easily replaced with actual API calls.
